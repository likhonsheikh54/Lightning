## ⚙️ GitHub Actions: CI/CD Pipeline

**Lightning** integrates with **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). Every push to the `main` branch will trigger an automated build, test, and deployment process to **Vercel**.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow automates the following tasks:

- **Build**: Installs dependencies, builds the project, and runs tests.
- **Deploy**: Deploys the app to **Vercel** if the build passes successfully.

### Create GitHub Actions Workflow File

To create the workflow, add the following `.github/workflows/main.yml` file to your repository:

```
yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build and Deploy
        run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        run: npm run deploy
```

## 🛡️ Deployment Pipeline

1. **Push Changes**: After pushing changes to the `main` branch or opening a pull request, the GitHub Actions pipeline automatically triggers.
2. **CI/CD**: If all tests pass, your app is automatically deployed to **Vercel**.
3. **Monitor Deployments**: You can track the build and deployment status in the **Actions** tab of GitHub.
